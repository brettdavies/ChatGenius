## General Rules

1. **Follow Best Practices**:
   - Use type hints, logging, and docstrings as per global instructions.
   - Ensure your environment variables are managed securely.
2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use kebab-case for files and folders unless otherwise specified.
   - Prefix environment variables accessible to the frontend with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Update `.env.example` when new environment variables are introduced.
   - Store actual values in `.env.local` and never expose sensitive variables to the frontend.
4. **File Structure**:
   - Organize components, hooks, and utilities based on the provided project structure.
   - Keep shared and one-off components separate (e.g., `/components` vs. `/_components`).

## Git Rules

- Use lowercase for commit messages.
- Write concise summaries for commit messages.
- Include descriptions for non-obvious changes.
- Include **Feature ID(s)** in the commit summary for all features included in the commit.
  - Format: `type(scope): message [Feature ID(s): ID-001, ID-002]`
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    feat(auth): added OAuth login functionality [Feature ID(s): ID-003]
    ```

- For commits with multiple features or significant changes, use this extended format:
  ```plaintext
  type(scope): summary message [Feature ID(s): ID-001, ID-002]

  [ID-001] Feature Name:
  - Change 1
  - Change 2
  - Change 3

  [ID-002] Feature Name:
  - Change 1
  - Change 2
  - Change 3

  Breaking changes:
  - List any breaking changes here
  - One per line

  Additional notes:
  - Any other relevant information
  - Migration steps if needed
  ```

- Commit types:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

---

## Documentation Rules

- Update relevant markdown files as you work on features.
- Maintain evergreen documents by marking incomplete sections with `[[TODO]]` or notes for follow-up.
- Document API interactions, data flows, and any permissions required for functionality.
- Ensure `manifest.json` and other key configuration files are well-documented.
- When writing feature documentation, do not remove any headers or subheaders. If a header or subheader is not relevant to the feature, write "[[ Not relevant to this feature ]]".

---

## Frontend-Specific Rules

1. **Component Rules**:
   - Always declare whether a component is `use server` or `use client` at the top.
   - Maintain visual spacing in JSX with extra blank lines for readability.
2. **Data Fetching**:
   - Fetch data in server components and pass it as props to client components.
   - Use `/actions` for server actions and ensure they return ActionState.

---

## Backend-Specific Rules

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` columns in all tables.
   - Use enums for limited value sets (e.g., `membership: ["free", "pro"]`).
2. **Actions**:
   - CRUD actions should follow the pattern:
     - Create
     - Read
     - Update
     - Delete
   - Always include meaningful error handling and logging.

---

## Development Workflow

- Use proper version control with branching and commit conventions.
- Ensure all code passes tests in local and staging environments before deployment.
- Follow semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for releases.
- Maintain a clear changelog in `CHANGELOG.md`.
