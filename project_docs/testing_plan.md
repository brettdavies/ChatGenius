## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of the testing process are:

- To ensure that all features and APIs function as intended
- To identify and resolve bugs or regressions promptly
- To validate that the application meets performance, scalability, and usability requirements
- To maintain a high standard of code quality and reliability
- To verify API contract compliance and backward compatibility

---

## Testing Types

### API Testing

#### Components

1. **OpenAPI Documentation** (`/server/src/openapi/`):
   - Single source of truth for API contracts
   - Request/response type validation
   - Interactive API documentation
   - Structure:
     ```plaintext
     openapi/
     ├── schemas/           # Request/response type definitions
     ├── paths/            # Endpoint specifications
     ├── components/       # Reusable components
     └── index.ts         # Main OpenAPI configuration
     ```

2. **Curl-based Testing** (`/server/scripts/api-tests/`):
   - Automated endpoint testing
   - Development workflow validation
   - Structure:
     ```plaintext
     scripts/api-tests/
     ├── _common/
     │   ├── auth.sh        # Auth token management
     │   ├── env.sh         # Environment variables
     │   ├── setup.sh       # Test data initialization
     │   └── utils.sh       # Helper functions
     ├── auth/              # Auth-related tests
     └── run-all.sh         # Test runner
     ```

#### API Test Scenarios

1. **Authentication Tests**:
   - Login flows
   - Registration processes
   - Token management
   - Session handling

2. **Data Validation Tests**:
   - Request payload validation
   - Response structure verification
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Third-party API interactions
   - Database operations
   - Event handling
   - Real-time communication

### Unit Testing

- Focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation
- Ensures that smaller parts of the application behave as expected
- Mocks external dependencies
- Covers edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Testing

- Validates the interaction between different modules or services
- Ensures that combined functionalities work as intended
- Tests database interactions
- Verifies event handling and message flows

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- Tests the complete workflow from the user's perspective
- Ensures that the application functions correctly in real-world scenarios
- Validates critical user journeys
- Tests cross-component interactions

### Performance Testing

- Measures the application's responsiveness and stability
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimizes resource usage
- Validates scalability requirements
- Tests real-time communication performance

### Real-time Functionality Testing

- **SSE Connection Tests**:
  - Connection establishment and maintenance
  - Reconnection strategies
  - Event handling and processing
  - Message ordering validation

- **Real-time Feature Tests**:
  - Message delivery latency
  - Typing indicators
  - Presence updates
  - Read state synchronization

---

## Test Environments

### Configuration

- Uses `.env.test` for all test types
- Separate ports for different test types
- Isolated test databases
- Test-specific security keys

### Database Isolation

- Separate schemas per test run
- Automated schema creation/cleanup
- Test data management
- Consistent state between runs

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Test Environment Variables
TEST_PORT=3001
TEST_DB_NAME=chatgenius_test
TEST_DB_USER=test_user
TEST_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

## Test Case Structure

Use this consistent structure for all test cases:

| Field           | Description                                    |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Test Case ID    | Unique identifier (e.g., API-001)              |
| Description     | What is being tested                           |
| Preconditions   | Required setup or state                        |
| Test Steps      | Detailed steps to execute                      |
| Expected Result | What should happen                             |
| Actual Result   | What actually happened                         |
| Status          | Pass/Fail/Blocked                              |
| Notes           | Additional context or observations             |

Example:
```typescript
describe('Authentication API', () => {
  it('should login user with valid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
