## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of the testing process are:

- To ensure that all features function as intended.
- To identify and resolve bugs or regressions promptly.
- To validate that the application meets performance, scalability, and usability requirements.
- To maintain a high standard of code quality and reliability.

---

## Testing Methodologies

### Unit Testing

- Focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation.
- Ensures that smaller parts of the application behave as expected.

### Integration Testing

- Validates the interaction between different modules or services.
- Ensures that combined functionalities work as intended.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- Tests the complete workflow from the user's perspective.
- Ensures that the application functions correctly in real-world scenarios.

### Performance Testing

- Measures the application's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various loads.
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimizes resource usage.

### Regression Testing

- Verifies that new changes do not introduce unexpected issues in existing functionalities.

## Test Case Structure

Use the following table format for creating and managing test cases:

| Test Case ID | Description                          | Input            | Expected Output      | Status    | Test File Location                      | Notes                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| [[TC-001]]   | [[Brief Description]]               | [[Input Values]] | [[Expected Result]]  | [[Pass/Fail]] | `tests/unit/specific-test-file.spec.ts` | [[Additional Notes]] |

### Example Test Case

| Test Case ID | Description                          | Input            | Expected Output      | Status    | Test File Location                      | Notes                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|

## Testing Process

### Step 1: Test Plan Creation

- Identify the features or modules to be tested.
- Define the test cases and expected outcomes in the above format.
- Specify the test file location for each test case.

### Step 2: Test Execution

- Run automated tests for unit and integration cases using Jest.
- Conduct manual tests for complex workflows or new features.
- Execute E2E tests in staging environments using Cypress.

### Step 3: Bug Identification

- Document bugs identified during testing in the bug tracking system.
- Prioritize bugs based on severity and impact.

### Step 4: Bug Resolution

- Assign bugs to the appropriate developer for resolution.
- Retest the affected areas to ensure fixes are effective and do not introduce new issues.

### Step 5: Reporting and Documentation

- Document test results in the changelog or feature documentation.
- Provide feedback on areas of improvement for future iterations.

## Bug Reporting and Resolution

### Bug Reporting

Include the following details when reporting a bug:

- **Title**: A concise summary of the issue.
- **Description**: A detailed explanation, including steps to reproduce.
- **Severity**: Categorize as `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Critical`.
- **Environment**: Specify the environment (e.g., staging, production).
- **Attachments**: Include screenshots, logs, or videos as needed.

### Bug Resolution

1. Assign the bug to the appropriate developer.
2. Add the bug to the sprint backlog if applicable.
3. Verify the resolution with retesting.
4. Close the bug once validated.
