## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of the testing process are:

- To ensure that all features function as intended.
- To identify and resolve bugs or regressions promptly.
- To validate that the application meets performance, scalability, and usability requirements.

### Snapshot Testing Strategy

Snapshot tests are implemented for all major components to ensure UI consistency:

1. **Component States**:
   - Loading states
   - Error states
   - Empty states
   - Populated states

2. **Interaction States**:
   - Modal open/closed states
   - Form states
   - Authentication states

3. **Update Process**:
   - Run `npm test -- -u` to update snapshots
   - Review changes in PR process
   - Document visual changes
