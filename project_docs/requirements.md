## Functional Requirements

The following are the core functionalities that the system must implement to meet its goals.

### User Authentication

- The system must allow users to:
  - [P0] Register using OAuth (e.g., Google, Microsoft)
    - Critical for initial user onboarding
  - [P0] Login with valid credentials
    - Required for basic system access
  - [P1] Recover their account through email-based password reset
    - Important but not blocking for MVP

### Messaging

- Users must be able to:
  - [P0] Send and receive messages in real-time
    - Core messaging functionality
  - [P1] Edit and delete their own messages within a configurable timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes)
    - Quality of life feature
  - [P2] React to messages with emojis
    - Nice to have engagement feature
  - [P1] Create and respond to message threads
    - Important for conversation organization

### Channels and Direct Messages

- The system must support:
  - [P0] Public and private channels
    - Essential for team communication
  - [P0] Direct messaging between two users
    - Critical for private communications
  - [P1] Channel creation and user management (add/remove participants)
    - Important for team organization

### File Sharing

- Users must be able to:

    - Important collaboration feature
  - [P1] Download shared files
    - Required companion to file upload
  - [P2] Search for files using keywords

## Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements define the operational qualities of the system, such as performance, security, and maintainability.

### Performance

- The system must handle at least 1,000 concurrent users with minimal latency (<500ms for message delivery).
- Real-time updates (e.g., typing indicators, new messages) must propagate within 1 second.

### Scalability

- The backend architecture must support scaling to 10,000 users with additional infrastructure.

### Security

- All user data must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).
- Authentication tokens must comply with the OAuth2 standard.
- User sessions must time out after 30 minutes of inactivity by default.

### Usability

- The user interface must follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).
- The system must provide a responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Reliability

- The system must achieve 99.9% uptime over a calendar month.
- Database recovery must occur within 10 minutes in the event of a failure.

### Maintainability

- The codebase must follow consistent coding standards (see `.cursorrules`).
- The system must include automated tests for at least 80% of critical paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

These criteria define when the system or individual features are considered complete.

### General Criteria

- Features must pass all associated test cases as defined in the **Testing Plan**.
- Documentation (feature templates, changelogs, and user-facing guides) must be up-to-date.

### Example Feature: Messaging

- Users can send a message, and it appears in the recipient's chat window within 1 second.
- Messages can be edited or deleted only within the allowed timeframe.
- Real-time message updates (typing indicators, new messages) are visible to all participants.

### Example Feature: User Authentication

- Users can successfully register, login, and reset their password.
- OAuth integration supports at least two providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
