# Feature Specification: SSE Infrastructure

## Basic Information

- **Feature ID**: DB-F-003
- **Feature Name**: SSE Infrastructure
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ðŸŸ© Completed
- **Last Updated**: 2024-01-12

## Overview

This feature implements Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication in ChatGenius. It provides a reliable, authenticated, and scalable unidirectional communication channel from server to client, enabling instant updates for messages, reactions, and status changes.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

| ID | As a | I want to | So that | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| US-001 | Developer | Set up secure SSE connections | I can send updates to authenticated clients | - Auth0 JWT validation on connect<br>- CORS properly configured<br>- Rate limiting per user |
| US-002 | Client | Maintain stable connections | Updates are received reliably | - Auto-reconnection works<br>- Events buffered during reconnect<br>- Connection health monitored |
| US-003 | Admin | Monitor SSE system health | I can ensure system stability | - Connection metrics tracked<br>- Error rates monitored<br>- Resource usage tracked |

## Technical Implementation

### Security Requirements

- Auth0 JWT validation for all SSE connections
- CORS configuration for allowed origins
- Rate limiting for connections per user
- Resource cleanup on disconnection
- Payload sanitization

### Frontend Requirements

1. Connection Interface:
   - Connect/disconnect methods
   - Channel subscription management
   - Connection status tracking
   - Error state handling

2. Event Types:
   - Message events (created, updated, deleted)
   - User events (typing, presence)
   - System events (health, errors)

3. State Management:
   - Connection status tracking
   - Event routing to stores
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Error handling

### Backend Requirements

1. API Requirements:
   - SSE endpoint with auth
   - Connection management
   - Event broadcasting
   - Health checks

2. Connection Management:
   - Track active connections
   - Clean up stale connections
   - Handle client disconnects
   - Manage connection limits

### Configuration

1. Environment Variables:
   - CORS_ORIGIN: Allowed origins
   - MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER: Connection limit
   - HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: Keep-alive timing

2. Feature Flags:
   - ENABLE_SSE: Toggle SSE functionality
   - ENABLE_COMPRESSION: Toggle payload compression

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Connection lifecycle management
- Event broadcasting functionality
- Auth validation
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Auth0 integration
- Event system integration
- Client reconnection flows
- Load handling

### E2E Tests

[[ Not relevant to this feature ]]

## Monitoring Requirements

### Logging

1. Required Events:
   - Connection lifecycle events
   - Authentication attempts
   - Broadcast operations
   - Error conditions

2. Log Format:
   - Connection ID
   - User ID
   - Event type
   - Timestamp
   - Error details if applicable

### Metrics

1. Performance Metrics:
   - Active connections count
   - Connection duration
   - Broadcast latency
   - Memory usage

2. Business Metrics:
   - Events per second
   - Users connected
   - Reconnection rate
   - Error rate

## Dependencies

- Auth0 Social Login (CORE-F-001)
- Event System (DB-F-002)

## Rollback Plan

1. Disable SSE via feature flag
2. Revert to polling fallback
3. Update client configuration
4. Adjust monitoring
