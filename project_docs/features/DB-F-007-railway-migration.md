# Feature Specification: Railway Database Migration

## Basic Information

- **Feature ID**: DB-F-007
- **Feature Name**: Railway Database Migration
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¨ In Progress
- **Last Updated**: 2024-03-20

## Overview

Migrate the PostgreSQL database from local development to Railway.app for improved scalability, management, and deployment integration. This migration includes setting up the database instance in Railway, migrating the schema, and updating all database connection configurations.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

| ID | As a | I want to | So that | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| US-001 | Developer | To have a managed PostgreSQL instance | I don't have to manage database infrastructure | - Database is provisioned in Railway<br>- Connection is secure and stable<br>- Database is accessible via CLI |
| US-002 | Developer | To migrate the existing schema | The database structure is preserved | - All tables are created<br>- All indexes are created<br>- All constraints are preserved |
| US-003 | Developer | To have proper connection configuration | The application can connect to the database | - Environment variables are updated<br>- Connection string is properly formatted<br>- SSH tunnel configuration is removed |

## Technical Implementation

### Security Requirements

- SSL/TLS encryption for all database connections
- Secure storage of database credentials
- No exposure of connection strings in code or version control
- Regular credential rotation capability

### Backend Changes

1. Configuration Updates:
   - Remove SSH tunnel configuration
   - Update database connection string format
   - Update environment variable structure

2. Connection Management:
   - Update connection pooling configuration
   - Implement proper error handling for Railway connections
   - Add reconnection logic for Railway specifics

Example patterns:

```typescript
interface DatabaseConfig {
  connectionString: string;
  ssl: boolean;
  max: number; // connection pool size
  idleTimeoutMillis: number;
}
```

### Database Changes

1. Schema Migration:
   - Migrate complete schema to Railway
   - Verify all constraints and indexes
   - Remove Supabase-specific configurations

2. Connection Updates:
   - Update connection string format
   - Configure proper SSL settings
   - Set up connection pooling

Example migration verification:

```sql
-- Verify tables
SELECT table_name, table_type 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Verify indexes
SELECT tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Configuration

1. Environment Variables:
   - DATABASE_URL: Railway connection string
   - PGHOST: Railway host
   - PGPORT: Railway port
   - PGUSER: Database user
   - PGPASSWORD: Database password
   - PGDATABASE: Database name

2. Feature Flags:
   - ENABLE_SSL: true for Railway connections
   - USE_CONNECTION_POOLING: true for production

## Testing Requirements

### Integration Tests

1. Connection Testing:
   - Verify successful connections
   - Test connection pooling
   - Verify SSL/TLS encryption
   - Test reconnection scenarios

2. Schema Verification:
   - Verify all tables exist
   - Verify all indexes
   - Verify all constraints
   - Test CRUD operations

## Monitoring Requirements

### Logging

1. Required Log Events:
   - Connection establishment
   - Connection failures
   - Pool creation
   - Pool overflow

Example format:

```typescript
interface DatabaseLogEvent {
  timestamp: string;
  event: 'connection' | 'error' | 'pool';
  status: 'success' | 'failure';
  details: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Metrics

1. Performance Metrics:
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Query response times
   - Error rates
   - Connection attempts

## Definition of Done

- [x] Railway database provisioned
- [x] Schema successfully migrated
- [x] Connection configuration updated
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] CLI access configured
- [ ] Connection pooling optimized
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Dependencies

- External services:
  - Railway.app: Database hosting
- Internal dependencies:
  - Features: DB-F-001 (Schema Setup)
- Third-party packages:
  - @railway/cli: Railway CLI tools

## Rollback Plan

1. Keep local PostgreSQL setup as backup
2. Document Railway database credentials
3. Maintain ability to switch back to local setup
4. Keep SSH tunnel configuration as backup
