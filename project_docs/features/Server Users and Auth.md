## 1. Detailed User & Auth Implementation Guide

Below is a verbose, step-by-step plan for implementing the user system and authentication layer, ensuring alignment with your client’s expectations and the established database schema.

---

### 1.1 Database Setup for Users

1. Confirm “users” Table Structure:  
   - Ensure each row has columns for:
     - id (ULID, unique and not null)  
     - email (must be unique, not null)  
     - password (hashed, not null)  
     - username (human-readable handle, not null, may also be unique)  
     - role (defaults to “user” if not provided)  
     - created_at, updated_at (timestamp columns)  
     - deleted_at (nullable, supports soft-delete)  

2. Create Necessary Indexes:  
   - Index on email for faster login lookups (e.g., idx_users_email).  
   - Index on username if the client supports direct username-based queries.  
   - Create triggers or migrations to auto-update updated_at whenever a row changes.  

3. Soft-Delete vs. Hard Delete Strategy:  
   - Deleting a user account marks the record via deleted_at, ensure all queries exclude soft-deleted rows unless explicitly needed.

4. Outline Basic Queries (in Pseudocode):  
   - CREATE USER (Registration): Inserts email, username, hashed password, etc.  
   - FIND USER BY EMAIL (Login Lookup):  
       - Filter on email and limit to 1 result.  
       - Exclude rows where deleted_at is not null.  
   - FIND USER BY ID (Session Validation):  
       - Similar approach, filter by ID.  
   - UPDATE USER STATUS (Online/Offline):  
       - Possibly a status column or last_seen_at column.  
       - Update user row to reflect the current state.

### 1.2 Auth Routes Overview

You will define routes/functions that handle user creation, authentication, and authentication checks:

1. Registration (POST /auth/register)
   - Accepts JSON with email, username, password.
   - Validates email format (if required) and checks for duplicates in email or username to avoid collisions.
   - If duplicates are found, returns a 409 Conflict response.
   - Once validated, proceeds with the following steps:
     - Generates a ULID before storing.
     - Hashes the password before storing.
     - Returns a response containing user details (excluding the password).

2. Login (POST /auth/login)
   - Accepts JSON with email and password.
   - Looks up user by email.
   - Checks if the provided password matches the hashed password.
   - If valid, creates a session token or sets up a cookie-based session.
   - Returns the user object (minus password) in JSON.
   - Consider storing a token in an httpOnly cookie or returning a bearer token depending on your client’s setup.  

3. Logout (POST /auth/logout or DELETE /auth/logout)
   - Invalidates the user’s session in your session store or token manager.
   - Returns a success message.

4. Current User (GET /auth/me)  
   - Retrieves the user info based on an active session or token.
   - Returns the user object without the password.
   - If the user is not authenticated, responds with an error code (e.g., 401).

5. Error Handling  
   - Consistently return structured error responses (e.g., status code 400 or 401 plus a JSON body with an “error” message).  
   - For password mismatch or user not found, use a generic message like “Invalid credentials” to avoid revealing which piece is incorrect.

### 1.3 OpenAPI / API Documentation

Your OpenAPI documentation should describe the request/response schemas and potential responses (including validation errors). Here is how to structure it conceptually:

1. Components → Schemas  
   - User: A schema defining id, email, username, role, createdAt, updatedAt.  
   - AuthRequest: Fields for email, password.  
   - RegisterRequest: Fields for email, username, password.  

2. Paths  
   - /auth/register:  
     - POST:  
       - Request Body: RegisterRequest  
       - Responses:  
         - 201 (Created): Returns the new user object.  
         - 400 (Bad Request): If validation fails.  
         - 409 (Conflict): If the email or username is already taken.  
   - /auth/login:  
     - POST:  
       - Request Body: AuthRequest  
       - Responses:  
         - 200 (OK): Returns the user object or session token.  
         - 401 (Unauthorized): Incorrect credentials.  
   - /auth/me:  
     - GET:  
       - Responses:  
         - 200 (OK): Returns the user object.  
         - 401 (Unauthorized): If the session/token is invalid.  
   - /auth/logout:  
     - POST or DELETE:  
       - Responses:  
         - 204 (No Content) or 200 (OK): Logout success.  
         - 401 (Unauthorized): Session not valid or already ended.  

3. Request Examples & Validation  
   - Provide example JSON for registration:  
     {
       "email": "example@example.com",
       "username": "ExampleUser",
       "password": "StrongPass123!"
     }  
   - For login:  
     {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "password": "Pa$$w0rd"
     }  
   - Define constraints like minimum password length, required email format, etc.

---

### 1.4 Security & Session Management

1. Basic Session Auth using Passport.js  
   - Rely on an in-memory or database-backed session (e.g., Express sessions).  
   - Use Passport.js local strategy for username/email and password authentication—no tokens involved.  
   - The client communicates with the server using normal session cookies, rather than bearer tokens.  
   - Because this is an internal proof-of-concept, minimal security measures are acceptable; the key is simply verifying local credentials.

2. Password Hashing  
   - Use a well-established library (e.g., bcrypt or argon2) for all stored passwords.  
   - When a user registers, transform their plaintext password into a secure hash and store only the hash.  
   - On login, Passport’s local strategy will compare the user-provided plaintext password (hashed at runtime) with the stored hash.

---

### 1.5 Validation & Error Handling

1. Validation Libraries  
   - Use a standard validation library or built-in framework validations to check request bodies.  
   - Return user-friendly messages on what failed (e.g., “Invalid email format”).  

2. Centralized Error Handler  
   - In your server framework, define a middleware or catch-all for thrown errors.  
   - Convert them into consistent JSON responses.  
   - Log the error details (stack trace) for debugging but avoid exposing internals in the response.  

3. Edge Cases  
   - Duplicate email or username.  
   - Length constraints for passwords.  
   - Attempt to register while logged in.  
   - Session expiration or token invalidation.  

---

### 1.6 Testing Strategy (OpenAPI-Focused)

Since you are only using OpenAPI for testing, consider the following approach:

1. **Contract Tests**  
   - Write tests that feed known valid or invalid inputs into each endpoint.  
   - Verify that the server responses match the documented OpenAPI spec (status codes, JSON structure, etc.).  

2. **Positive Scenarios**  
   - A normal user can register, log in, fetch their profile, and log out.  
   - The user gets valid JSON responses containing their user ID and role, etc.  

3. **Negative Scenarios**  
   - Invalid email or password yields a 400 or 401 error.  
   - Duplicate email yields a 409 or 400.  
   - Accessing /auth/me without a valid session yields 401.  

4. **Automate as Much as Possible**
   - Mark test results in a log or coverage summary.

---

### 1.7 Putting It All Together

1. **Create**  
   - Add or confirm any missing columns/indexes in your “users” table.  
   - Make sure the default values/constraints align with your plan (e.g., role defaults to “user,” createdAt defaults to now).  
   - Do not create any migrations. Make any changes to the database schema directly.

2. **Implement Route Handlers**  
   - For each route (register/login/logout/me), write the logic in your chosen server framework (e.g., Express, Fastify, etc.).  
   - Integrate frameworks/middlewares for authentication or session handling.  

3. **Hook Up to OpenAPI**  
   - Use swagger-ui to display your spec.  
   - Ensure your routes match the endpoints described in your OpenAPI documentation (paths, methods, etc.).  

4. **Validate and Deploy**  
   - Confirm everything is stable by locally running your server and testing endpoints with an HTTP client (curl).  
   - Deploy your server to the environment where the client runs, ensuring your .env or config variables (database URL, etc.) are set correctly.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you ensure a robust user and auth flow supporting standard actions like registration, login, logout, and current user retrieval. The process emphasizes database schema alignment, secure password handling, consistent error handling, and OpenAPI-driven testing, all without introducing mention or channel-specific complexities before you’re ready.
