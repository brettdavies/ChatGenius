## Rationale for Technology Choices

### Frontend

- **React**: Provides a component-based architecture, ideal for building scalable UIs.
- **MUI**: Offers a rich library of pre-styled UI components, reducing development time.
- **Vite**: Ensures fast builds and hot module replacement for a seamless development experience.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: Non-blocking architecture supports high concurrency.
- **Express**: Simplifies building REST APIs and middleware-based services.

### Realtime Communication

- **WebSocket**: Enables instant updates for features like messaging and typing indicators.
- **Feather.js**: Streamlines WebSocket implementation with built-in event handling.

### Database

- **Postgres**: A proven, reliable relational database that scales with application needs.
- **Supabase**: Offers managed Postgres with real-time subscriptions, reducing backend complexity.

### Authentication

- **Auth0**: Handles user authentication securely while supporting OAuth, JWT, and session management.

### Deployment

- **Vercel**: Simplifies deployment and provides built-in CI/CD for a streamlined release pipeline.

## Future Technology Considerations

- Evaluate serverless functions for scaling compute-intensive operations.
- Consider GraphQL for optimizing API queries and responses.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The system follows a client-server architecture, with a focus on real-time communication. Below is a high-level depiction of the system’s architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|HTTP/WebSocket| B[Frontend (React)]
    B -->|REST API| C[Backend (Node.js + Express)]
    C -->|Database Queries| D[Database (Postgres)]
    C -->|Auth Requests| E[Auth0]
    C -->|Real-time Updates| F[WebSocket Service]
```

### Component Breakdown

1. Frontend:
   - Manages UI rendering and user interactions.
   - Uses React Router for navigation and MUI for consistent styling.
2. Backend:
   - Handles API requests, user authentication, and database interactions.
   - Implements WebSocket communication for real-time features.
3. Database:
   - Stores user data, messages, channels, and other application data.
   - Supports relational queries and transactions for consistency.
4. Authentication:
   - Auth0 manages user sessions and integrates seamlessly with backend APIs.
5. Deployment:
   - Vercel hosts the frontend and backend with automatic scaling and versioning.

## Integration Points

### External Services

- Auth0: Integrated for OAuth-based login and secure token management.
- Supabase: Used for database hosting and real-time updates.

### APIs

- Internal APIs: Define RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on messages, channels, and users.
- Third-Party APIs: Examples include external file storage (e.g., AWS S3) or analytics services.

### Sample API Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `POST /auth/login`  
**Description**: Authenticates users and returns an access token.  
**Request**:

   ```json
   {
   "username": "user@example.com",
   "password": "securepassword"
   }
   ```

**Response**:

   ```json
   {
   "access_token": "eyJhbGc....",
   "refresh_token": "eyJhbGc....",
   "expires_in": 3600
   }
   ```

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

1. Frontend:
   - Use lazy loading for routes and components to reduce initial load times.
   - Optimize assets with Vite’s bundling capabilities.
2. Backend:
   - Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
   - Use a connection pool manager for Postgres to handle high query loads.
3. Database:
   - Index frequently queried fields (e.g., user_id, channel_id) to speed up lookups.
   - Use database sharding for horizontal scaling as the application grows.
4. Realtime Communication:
   - Use message throttling to prevent WebSocket overload.
   - Leverage Feather.js event hooks for efficient real-time updates.
5. Deployment:
   - Enable Vercel’s edge caching to reduce latency for static assets.
   - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) for proactive performance management.
