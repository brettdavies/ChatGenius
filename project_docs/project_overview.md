### Frontend Stack

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Server Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express with TypeScript
- **API Style**: RESTful with SSE
- **Authentication**: Passport.js + Session
- **Testing**: Jest + Supertest
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

### Real-time Implementation

The application uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates:

1. **Event Service**:
   ```typescript
   // Example channel event emission in services
   private realtimeService = RealtimeService.getInstance();

   async createChannel(data: CreateChannelInput): Promise<Channel> {
     const channel = await createChannelInDB(data);
     
     await this.realtimeService.emit({
       type: ChannelEventType.CHANNEL_CREATED,
       channelId: channel.id,
       userId: data.createdBy,
       timestamp: new Date(),
       data: channel
     });
     
     return channel;
   }
   ```

2. **Event Types**:
   - Channel operations (create, update, archive, delete)
   - Member changes (join, leave, role updates)
   - Typing indicators
   - Presence updates

3. **Connection Management**:
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Event buffering
   - Connection pooling
   - Proper cleanup on disconnect

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Event batching for multiple rapid updates
   - Connection limits per user
   - Event filtering based on user permissions
   - Efficient event routing

5. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Channel Creation: 10 requests per hour
   - Channel Updates: 30 requests per minute
   - Channel Member Operations: 50 requests per 5 minutes
   - Channel Deletion: 10 requests per hour
   - Channel Archival: 10 requests per hour
   - Channel Read Operations: 100 requests per minute

6. **Environment Configuration**:
   Rate limits are configurable through environment variables:
   - Create operations: `CHANNEL_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_*`
   - Update operations: `CHANNEL_UPDATE_RATE_LIMIT_*`
   - Member operations: `CHANNEL_MEMBERS_RATE_LIMIT_*`
   - Delete operations: `CHANNEL_DELETE_RATE_LIMIT_*`
   - Archive operations: `CHANNEL_ARCHIVE_RATE_LIMIT_*`
   - Read operations: `CHANNEL_READ_RATE_LIMIT_*`

7. **Client Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Example SSE client connection
   const events = new EventSource('/api/events/channels/${channelId}/events');
   
   events.onmessage = (event) => {
     const channelEvent = JSON.parse(event.data);
     // Handle different event types
     switch (channelEvent.type) {
       case 'channel.created':
         // Update UI with new channel
         break;
       case 'channel.member_joined':
         // Update member list
         break;
       // ... handle other events
     }
   };
   ```

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Automatic retry on connection failure
   - Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Event queue management during disconnection
   - Graceful degradation to polling if SSE fails

### Database Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (self-hosted)
- **Connection**: node-postgres with connection pooling
- **Security**: SSL/TLS encryption
- **Events**: LISTEN/NOTIFY
- **Migrations**: Custom migration system
- **Testing**: Integration tests

---

## Rate Limiting

The application implements rate limiting to protect against abuse and ensure fair resource usage. Rate limits are configured through environment variables and can be adjusted based on deployment requirements.

### Channel Operations
- **Creation**: 10 requests per hour
- **Updates**: 30 requests per minute
- **Member Operations**: 50 requests per 5 minutes
- **Deletion**: 10 requests per hour
- **Archival**: 10 requests per hour
- **Read Operations**: 100 requests per minute

### Real-time Events
- **Event Subscriptions**: 1 connection per channel per user per hour
  - Ensures each user can only maintain one active SSE connection per channel
  - Prevents connection flooding
- **Typing Indicators**: 30 updates per minute
  - Balances real-time feedback with server load
  - Sufficient for normal typing behavior
- **Presence Updates**: 60 updates per minute
  - Allows for frequent presence status changes
  - Maintains real-time presence information without overwhelming the server

### Implementation
Rate limiting is implemented using `express-rate-limit` with the following features:
- IP-based rate limiting with support for proxy forwarding
- Standard rate limit headers (`RateLimit-*`)
- Configurable through environment variables
- Custom error messages with error codes
- Separate limits for different operation types

Example configuration:
```typescript
// Rate limit for SSE connections
export const eventSubscriptionLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: ENV.RATE_LIMIT.EVENTS.SUBSCRIPTION.WINDOW_MS, // 1 hour
  max: ENV.RATE_LIMIT.EVENTS.SUBSCRIPTION.MAX_REQUESTS,   // 1 request
  message: {
    message: 'Too many event subscriptions',
    code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED'
  }
});
```

### Environment Variables
Rate limits can be configured through the following environment variables:
```env
# Channel rate limits
CHANNEL_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=3600000
CHANNEL_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10

# Event rate limits
EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=3600000
EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1
EVENT_TYPING_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
EVENT_TYPING_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=30
EVENT_PRESENCE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
EVENT_PRESENCE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=60
```

### Error Handling
When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns:
- Status code: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Response body:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Too many requests, please try again later",
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
  }
  ```
- Headers:
  - `RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the window
  - `RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current window
  - `RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)
