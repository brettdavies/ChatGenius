## Project Vision

[[Describe the overarching purpose of ChatGenius...]]

Example:  
The goal of ChatGenius is to replicate Slack's functionality...

---

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives

- [[Objective 1: e.g., Deliver a fully functional Slack clone with core features such as messaging, channels, file sharing, and threads.]]
- [[Objective 2: e.g., Build a scalable architecture for integrating AI-powered features in subsequent phases.]]

### Secondary Objectives

- [[Objective 3: e.g., Ensure the user interface closely matches Slack's design standards.]]
- [[Objective 4: e.g., Provide a foundation for efficient development workflows and team collaboration.]]

---

## Scope

### In-Scope

- [[List features, functionalities, or components that are part of the project's first phase. For example:]]
  - Real-time messaging with WebSocket-based communication.
  - User authentication via OAuth2 and Auth0.
  - Channel and direct message organization.
  - File sharing with basic search functionality.
  - Slack-like threading and emoji reactions.

### Out-of-Scope

- [[List what the project will explicitly NOT include in this phase. For example:]]
  - AI-powered features such as digital twins and advanced analytics (reserved for Phase 2).
  - Enterprise-level compliance features like SSO or multi-tenancy.
